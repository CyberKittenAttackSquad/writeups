# Cyber Kitten Attack Squad Writeups

## Introduction

This repo holds writeups for some of the challenges solved by the CTF team Cyber Kitten Attack Squad (CKAS).

## About CKAS

Some of these writeups follow a narrative, explaining what is going on while we solve challenges. A couple of things about CKAS.

* Our team is small. As of this writing, six people.
* We have a diverse team with experience in software development, formal program analysis, reverse-engineering, cryptography, exploit development, etc.. we cross train heavily and specialize when we need to. 
* We use [pwntools](http://pwntools.readthedocs.io/en/2.2/) aka pwnlib. This help different people solve different portions of a challenge and quickly pass off work to one another.
* We communicate over slack. If everyone is working, we have two channels for a competition, the *main* channel and the *alternate* channel, so we can work multiple challenges without stepping on one another.
* We announce what we're working on with `!working <challenge_name>` and when we solve a challenge, we announce it with `!solved <challenge_name>`. This helps us ensure we aren't duplicating efforts. We periodically check on who is working on what throughout the CTF.
* We have a standard VM created using vagrant, ensuring everyone has access to a basic set of tools.
